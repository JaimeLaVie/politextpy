## Why is *Politextpy* Developed?

We are overwhelmed by this era of overloading information, emerging misinformation and disinformation yet we are at the same time empowered by it to embark on an unprecedented journey of research for international issues. We are exhilarated by the unexampled possibilities computational methods brought us to delineate the dynamics of domestic and international politics. 

Online public opinion initiates our vision to entrench a novel field of study, *Computational Political Communication*. We hope to build up this vision brick by brick, and *Politextpy* is one of the founding bricks. We believe that it is not only for our own research but for further demand from a broader academia. With this open-source package, we hope to equip *Python* users to process English and Chinese languages text via **1) Preprocessing**, **2) Topic Models** and **3) Supervised/Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis**. And we are more than ever expected for more languages and functions to be added in the very near future.

#### Online Public Opinion as A New Approach

+ Pivot in Objects: Elites and Policy-Making vs. Public and Policy-Perception; 
+ Pivot to New Public Sphere: Crossing border/culture, Inter-formats, Weak-tie based;
+ Pivot to Personalized Expression: Sentiments, “Free Market,” Niche and private clusters.

#### Computational Political Communication as A New Attempt

+ Generating Data and Texts: Sufficient, even surfeit objects for computing;
+ Emerging Methods and Technology: Rapid developing Software & Hardware for research;
+ Arising Global Politics Issues: Interacting Geopolitics Dynamics, Major Powers Play, Aussenpolitik and Innenpolitik.
